# Warhammer_IV

First true encounter with SFML library.
Found this most entertaining way of learning language.

In overall game is "parody" of skirmish battle from Total War series. There is main menu, screen where you can choose
units for both sides of conflict and finally main battle where you can control ( totally logical ) both armies and let
them fight. This ( I shouldn't call this game ) was side for-fun project during my biggest curve of learning C++ language.
